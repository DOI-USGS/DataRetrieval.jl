# DataRetrieval.jl

DataRetrieval.jl is a Julia alternative to the R [dataRetrieval](https://code.usgs.gov/water/dataRetrieval) package for obtaining USGS water data directly from web services. There is also a [Python dataretrieval](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval) package designed to perform the same functionality in the Python language.

**Note:** Due to the both the relative newness of the Julia language and a lack of knowledge regarding its adoption within the water community, the development of this package will be subject to demand from the community. Consequently, please raise an [issue](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/iow/computational-tools/DataRetrieval.jl/-/issues) if there is functionality present in either the R or Python tools that you'd like added to the Julia package.
